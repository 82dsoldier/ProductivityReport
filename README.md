# PowerFront Coding Test
<p>This repository holds the PowerFront coding test for Drew Burchett.  The solution was created in Visual Studio 2019 and the database was created with SQL LocalDB.  The database compatiblity level was set to 110 to emulate SQL Server 2012 per the instructions.</p>
<p>The database structure can be created with the enclosed creation script and data can be added from the original creation script providied to me with this test.</p>
<p>The main project can be run in IIS Express and runs on http://localhost:50733.  The home view is the original project.  http://localhost:50733/Home/New_Index can be used to access my rewrite of the project.</p>
<p>The demo video is at the root of the project and is called demo.mp4.</p>
